            <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br>
            <p>
                When you work with us, you are part of the team of committed collaborators.
                All aspects of our software development process are intergrated, iterative and agile.<br>
                <br>
                Our approach unifies design, development and
                product management to create exceptional products.
                We start each project by understanding your business goals,
                the user's needs and the product requirements.
                Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

            <p>Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend necessary
                time to understand your product vision.
                The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal of high-level statement of work.
                Based on your requirement, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces
                you need.</p>
